Welcome! My name is Nick. I’m a Software Engineer and security enthusiast with experience in building distributed systems and integrating large amounts of data reliably. I am drawn towards creating tools and frameworks around offensive and defensive security operations.

When I’m not on my computer, I’m usually training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or exploring the city with my wife, toddler, and Goldendoodle.
